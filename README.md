# Nutrition Data Visualizer

This is a lightweight React app that queries the USDA's <a href='https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/api/doc'>NDB API</a>. Users can choose one of five nutrients and find out which foods contain the highest quantity per serving. The bar graph was created with <strong>react-chartjs-2</strong>, a React wrapper for <strong>Chart.js</strong>.
